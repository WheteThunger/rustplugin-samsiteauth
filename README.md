Makes SAM Sites act in a similar fashion to shotgun traps and flame turrets by checking if players operating vehicles are authorized on the cupboard.

Also prevents these SAM Sites from shooting cold vehicles (defined entities without pilots).

## Configuration

* `samsite.alltarget:` false is recommended, true makes samsite target other vehicles as well
* `Target heli (requires alltarget):` (true/false) **doesn't work currently**
