Makes SAM Sites act in a similar fashion to shotgun traps and flame turrets by checking if players flying minicopter/balloon are authorized on the cupboard.

Also prevents these SAM Sites from shooting cold vehicles (defined entities without pilots). 

Supports sedan and ch47 if you use the server setting samsite.alltarget true (console command)


Suggestions are appreciated.
