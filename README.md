Makes SAM Sites act in a similar fashion to shotgun traps and flame turrets by checking if players operating vehicles are authorized on the cupboard.

Also prevents these SAM Sites from shooting cold vehicles (defined entities without pilots).

Supports sedan, ch47 and patrol helicopter if you use set samsite.alltarget to true, see below.


## Configuration

* `samsite.alltarget:` (true/false)
* `Target heli (requires alltarget):` (true/false) **doesn't work anymore**
